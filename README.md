gumbuk 9, otherwise known as soap breaker in some places.
random eastern european who hates eastern europe (like every eastern european)

i map for the source engine, do light LUA scripting, decently successful at 3D asset creation for games,
would want to learn how to make music, want to some day learn C++, and other junk.

i'm still learning how to use github, so i might not understand how things work.
